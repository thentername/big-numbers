# big-numbers
A randomizer chooses from a list of 996! (996 factorial) numbers, creates 6! lists of primes numbers with the lower number is a random choice from 
the list of 996! numbers and the upper being a choice from the list of 996! factorial greater than lower. A list is made with a length of the prime number chosen
plus 12 and a number is chosen from that list randomly. A list of equations is created and an equation is chosen. It then plugs the numbers into that equation
and finally prints the results.
